### Required

- `azure_func_region` (String) Region in which azure cloud function will be provisioned
- `cloud_connector_id` (String) Id of the cloud connector
- `delete_cloud_resources_on_destroy` (Boolean) Governs how the loadabalancer entity will be deleted on Terraform destroy. When set to true, the associated Application Gateway will be deleted permanently from Azure account. Be fully aware of the consequneces of settting this to true, as the action is irreversible. When set to false, solely the Harness LB representation will be deleted, leaving the cloud resources intact.
- `host_name` (String) Hostname for the proxy
- `name` (String) Name of the proxy
- `region` (String) Region in which cloud resources are hosted
- `resource_group` (String) Resource group in which cloud resources are hosted
- `vpc` (String) VNet in which cloud resources are hosted. Required only for creating new AppGateway

### Optional

- `app_gateway_id` (String) ID of Azure AppGateway for importing. Required only for importing exiging AppGateway
- `certificate_id` (String) ID of existing SSL certificate from AppGateway being imported. Required only for importing existing AppGateway. Required only for SSL based rules
- `frontend_ip` (String) ID of IP address to be used. Required only for creating new AppGateway. See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-components#static-versus-dynamic-public-ip-address for more details
- `sku_size` (String) Size of machine used for the gateway. Required only for creating new AppGateway
- `subnet_id` (String) Subnet in which cloud resources are hosted. Required only for creating new AppGateway

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `identifier` (String) Unique identifier of the resource
