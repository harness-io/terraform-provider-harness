## Example Usage

```terraform
//To create a role binding in service account
resource "harness_platform_role_assignments" "example1" {
  org_id                    = "org_id"
  project_id                = "project_id"
  resource_group_identifier = "_all_project_level_resources"
  role_identifier           = "_project_viewer"
  principal {
    identifier = harness_platform_service_account.test.id
    type       = "SERVICE_ACCOUNT"
  }
  disabled = false
  managed  = false
}

//To create a role binding in user group 
resource "harness_platform_role_assignments" "example1" {
  org_id                    = "org_id"
  project_id                = "project_id"
  resource_group_identifier = "_all_project_level_resources"
  role_identifier           = "_project_viewer"
  principal {
    identifier = harness_platform_usergroup.test.id
    type       = "USER_GROUP"
  }
  disabled = false
  managed  = false
}

resource "harness_platform_role_assignments" "example2" {
  identifier                = "identifier"
  org_id                    = "org_id"
  project_id                = "project_id"
  resource_group_identifier = "_all_project_level_resources"
  role_identifier           = "_project_viewer"

  org_id                    = "org_id"
  project_id                = "project_id"
  resource_group_identifier = "_all_project_level_resources"
  role_identifier           = "_project_viewer"
  principal {
    identifier = "service_id"
    type       = "SERVICE"
  }
  disabled = false
  managed  = false
}

resource "harness_platform_role_assignments" "example2" {
  org_id                    = "org_id"
  project_id                = "project_id"
  resource_group_identifier = "_all_project_level_resources"
  role_identifier           = "_project_viewer"
  principal {
    identifier = "api_key_id"
    type       = "API_KEY"
  }
  disabled = false

## Schema

### Required

- `principal` (Block List, Min: 1) Principal. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--principal))
- `resource_group_identifier` (String) Resource group identifier.
- `role_identifier` (String) Role identifier.

### Optional

- `disabled` (Boolean) The `disabled` attribute in the role assignment resource controls the status of the role assignment. Setting `disabled` to `false` activates the role and its permissions, enabling the assigned entity to perform allowed actions. Conversely, setting `disabled` to `true` deactivates the role, revoking the entity's permissions and action capabilities. Default value should be `false`.
- `identifier` (String) Identifier for role assignment.
- `managed` (Boolean) Specifies whether the role assignment is managed by Harness. Setting managed to `true` means that Harness will manage the lifecycle of the role assignment, including its creation, updates, and deletion. Conversely, setting it to `false` indicates that the role assignment is not managed by Harness, and thus Harness will not perform actions on it. Default value should be `false`.
- `org_id` (String) Org identifier.
- `project_id` (String) Project Identifier

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--principal"></a>
### Nested Schema for `principal`

Required:

- `type` (String) Type.

Optional:

- `identifier` (String) Identifier.
- `scope_level` (String) Scope level.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Import account level role assignments
terraform import harness_platform_role_assignments.example <role_assignments_id>

# Import org level role assignments
terraform import harness_platform_role_assignments.example <ord_id>/<role_assignments_id>

# Import project level role assignments
terraform import harness_platform_role_assignments.example <org_id>/<project_id>/<role_assignments_id>
```
