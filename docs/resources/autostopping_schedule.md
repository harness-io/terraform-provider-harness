## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the schedule
- `rules` (List of Number) ID of AutoStopping rules on which the schedule applies
- `schedule_type` (String) Type of the schedule. Valid values are `uptime` and `downtime`
- `time_zone` (String) Time zone in which schedule needs to be executed

### Optional

- `ending_on` (String) Time until which schedule will be active. Need to be in YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS format. Eg 2006-01-02 15:04:05
- `repeats` (Block List) For defining periodic schedule. Periodic nature will be applicable from the time of creation of schedule, unless specific 'time_period' is specified (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--repeats))
- `starting_from` (String) Time from which schedule will be active. Schedule will take immediate effect if starting_from is not specified. Need to be in YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS format. Eg 2006-01-02 15:04:05

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `identifier` (Number) Unique identifier of the schedule

<a id="nestedblock--repeats"></a>
### Nested Schema for `repeats`

Required:

- `days` (String) Days on which schedule need to be active. Comma separated values of `SUN`, `MON`, `TUE`, `WED`, `THU`, `FRI` and `SAT`. Eg : `MON,TUE,WED,THU,FRI` for Mon through Friday

Optional:

- `end_time` (String) Ending time of schedule action on the day. Defaults to 24:00Hrs unless specified. Accepted format is HH:MM. Eg : 20:00 for 8pm
